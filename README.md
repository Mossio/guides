Guidelines
==========

At Mossio we value quality of work, and one way to achieve that is through
consistency. Much like a rowing team is efficient if all of the rowers are in
sync, you will be efficient if you and your teammates are all doing your job in
the same way. The goal of this repo is to collect a sensible, reasonable set of
standards for use on any project, whether you're a designer or a developer.

Here's how this works:

* Anyone can contribute a new guideline or modify an existing guideline, but
  please make a pull request first and keep the pull request open for at least a
  week to allow for discussion. You may merge in the pull request if a majority
  of people are in approval.
* When working on a project, please strive to follow these guidelines as much as
  possible.
* If you feel like a guideline does not apply to your
  situation and you do not wish to follow it, make sure that your teammates are
  aware why you're doing so and seek an alternate opinion. Better yet, if you
  feel that everyone would be better served by changing the guideline, feel free
  to submit a pull request.

A guideline can have one of three directions:

* **Don't** -- You really shouldn't ever violate this guideline.
* **Avoid** -- Don't violate this guideline if you can help it, although you're
  allowed to if you can convince another teammate.
* **Prefer** -- This guideline presents two options and suggests a better one
  over one that you should watch out for.
