Guidelines
==========

At Mossio we value quality of work, and one way to achieve that is through
consistency. Much like a rowing team works best if all of the rowers are in
sync, our hope is that developers and designers on a project will work best if
they're all doing things the same way. The goal of this repo, then, is to
collect all of the knowledge for working well together into a sensible,
reasonable set of standards and protocols.

Here's how this works:

* Anyone can contribute a new guideline or modify an existing guideline, but
  please make a pull request first and keep the pull request open for at least a
  week to allow for discussion. You may merge in the pull request if a majority
  of people are in approval.
* When working on a project, please strive to follow these guidelines as much as
  possible.
* If you feel like a guideline does not apply to your situation and you do not
  wish to follow it, make sure that your teammates are aware why you're doing so
  and seek an alternate opinion. Better yet, if you feel that everyone would be
  better served by changing the guideline, feel free to submit a pull request.
